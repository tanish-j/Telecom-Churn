# Telecom-Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using various machine learning techniques. By identifying customers likely to leave, the company can take proactive measures to retain them.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You will also need Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook for running and editing the notebook.
Required Libraries: The project requires several Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc. These can be installed using the requirements.txt file.

## Installing

## Running the Tests
Breakdown of Tests
The Python script includes several tests to ensure the data is processed correctly and the model performs as expected. These include:

Checking for missing values in the dataset.
Validating the data types of each column.
Ensuring the target variable distribution is appropriate for modeling.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a predictive model and evaluating its performance.
To run the tests, you can use a testing framework like pytest. First, install pytest:
