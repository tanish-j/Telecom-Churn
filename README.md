## Telecom-Churn Prediction

## Short Description
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using various machine learning techniques. 
By identifying customers likely to leave, the company can take proactive measures to retain them.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. 
You will also need Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.x: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
1. Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook for running and editing the notebook.
2. Required Libraries: The project requires several Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc. 
   These can be installed using the requirements.txt file.

## Installing
Follow these steps to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-churn.git
   cd telecom-churn
   
2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**
   After cloning the repository, navigate into the repository directory. This is where all the project files are located.
   For Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   For MacOS/Linux:
   python3 -m venv venv
 
3. **Install the Prerequisites**
   Ensure all the prerequisites are installed. You can use the provided requirements.txt file to install all the necessary packages at once.
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Open Jupyter Notebook**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook to interact with the project code, especially if you have Jupyter notebooks as part of your project.
   jupyter notebook
   
5. **Run the Python Script**
   If you have a Python script for analysis, you can run it directly in your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook. 
   Hereâ€™s how to run a script named telecom_churn_analysis.py:
   python telecom_churn_analysis.py


## Running the Script
Once you have set up the environment and installed all the prerequisites, you can run the Python script to perform the analysis.
Example: python telecom_churn.py

## Getting Data Out
1. To demonstrate the analysis, you can run the script and observe the output. 
2. The script will load the telecom churn data, preprocess it, perform exploratory data analysis, and build a predictive model. 
3. The output will include various charts and metrics that help understand the churn patterns.


## Running the Tests
To run the automated tests for the churn dataset system:
**Install Dependencies:**
Ensure all required libraries and tools for testing are installed, such as Python packages (pandas, scikit-learn, pytest, etc.).
**Set Up the Test Environment:** 
Configure any environment variables or settings needed for the tests to access the churn dataset.
**Prepare the Dataset:**
Ensure the churn dataset is properly formatted and accessible for the tests.
**Run the Test Suite:** 
Execute the automated tests using a command like pytest or through an IDE that supports testing. Ensure the tests are designed to validate data processing, model performance, and accuracy.
**Check Test Results:** 
Review the output to identify any failed tests or issues. Examine logs or reports for detailed information on test outcomes.
**Address Issues:** 
If tests fail, debug and resolve issues in the code or dataset, then re-run the tests until they pass.


## Breakdown of Tests
The Python script includes several tests to ensure the data is processed correctly and the model performs as expected. These include:
. Checking for missing values in the dataset.
. Validating the data types of each column.
. Ensuring the target variable distribution is appropriate for modeling.
. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
. Training a predictive model and evaluating its performance.
. To run the tests, you can use a testing framework like pytest. First, install pytest:


## Deployment
To deploy the analysis in a production environment, follow these steps:

Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary packages.
Ensure the dataset is accessible in the specified location.
Run the Python script to perform the analysis and generate reports.
For example:
python telecom_churn.py
